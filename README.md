# agent2
Vfx test agent - with clickbars for swapping window layouts from RR/Vfx, and relay group RR's

work in progress - current agent i'm throwing my ideas at, didn't have time to try and get Vfx nicely into Basic Agent so I left it as is.
Everything will change with new updates - so i'm just spending time on testing things rather then cleaning things up nicely.

Setup for 2560x1080 - 1920x1080 monitor layout
Vfx view - Mouse2 or MouseWheel for selecting - they are also tied into swapping out of RR fixed Layout

Vfx3 - grid: 3 rows, 3 columns....grow to the right
Vfx4 - grid: 4 rows, 3 columns....grow to the right
Vfx5 - grid: 5 rows, 5 columns....grow to the bottom

Utility toggle buttons are on the left side of the screen: All, RR -not used anymore, Party, ActionBars, UI - not used
Toggle: Mouse1 on, MouseWheel off

Party Buttons are the only function ones atm - they overlay my party frames
*Mouse1 - focus toon
*Mouse2:  1st btn - toggle on RR for relaygroup party. 2nd btn - toggle on RR ranged group. 3rd button - disable RR. 4rth btn - toggle on RR mouse2 all 

first try at making a video with obs - turned out bad - need to look up better settings for OBS ...but you can get the gist of what this does.   
Quick run thru of the agents, then layouts and startup of Vfx3,4,5 - partyframe buttons for RR at the end - also put in a relaygroup for ranged RR
